At89prog was programmed with modularity in mind.

at89ser.c - Handles programming for the AT89S*
delays.c - Bunch of delay functions
pins-parallel.c - Parallel port backend for setting pins
pins-serial-raw.c - Direct ('raw') driver for the serial port (requires root)
pins-serial.c - User-level serial port backend
pins.c - Frontend for the various available 'pins'-backends. Does mapping 
	between the pins used by the microcontroller backend (at89ser.c) and 
	the pin backend (parallel, serial or serial-raw)
at89prog.c - Simple command-line frontend. 
at89prog-gtk.c - GTK frontend
hexfile.c - Function(s) for parsing intel hex files
