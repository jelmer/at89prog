===================================================
Serial port access is no longer 'direct' - instead of 
directly communicating with the hardware (which requires 
root access and only works with standard hardware), the 
serial port interface is now used.

The port type 'serial-raw' provides backwards compatibility 
for those still needing it. The new 'serial' port type (which 
is the default port type, works similar to 'serial-raw', except 
that it requires a filename instead of a base address. (e.g. 
not 2f8 but /dev/ttyS0)
